# Word Hunter

**Word Hunter** is an engaging word-finding game where players compete against time to discover as many words as possible from a grid of letters. Sharpen your vocabulary, speed, and strategic thinking while enjoying the challenge!

## Rules

1. **Goal**: Find as many words as possible from the grid of letters.  
2. **Forming Words**:  
   - Words can be formed by connecting adjacent letters:  
     - Horizontally  
     - Vertically  
     - Diagonally  
   - Words must be at least **3 letters long** and cannot be reused.  
   - Only words that exist in the dictionary are valid.  
3. **Scoring**: Each word earns points based on its length.  
4. **Time Limit**: Players have a limited time to hunt for words.  
5. **Difficulty Modes**: Choose from three difficulty levels:  
   - [1] Easy  
   - [2] Medium  
   - [3] Hard  

## Features

- Interactive gameplay with real-time scoring and a timer.  
- Recursive algorithms (DFS and BFS) for word validation and grid traversal.  
- Multiple difficulty modes for added challenge.  
- Integrated unit tests using **Google Test (GTest)** for robust validation.  

## Technologies Used

- **C++** for core game logic.  
- **Google Test (GTest)** for testing.  
- Recursive algorithms (DFS, BFS) to ensure efficient and accurate gameplay.
